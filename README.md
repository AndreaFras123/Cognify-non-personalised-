## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your computer.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd cognify
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Run the following command to install all the required packages for the project:
    ```bash

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the local development server:
